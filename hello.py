    Welcome to a simple interactive demonstration of :red[descrete event simulation]
    modelling using the package :red[SimPy]!
    This app allows you to alter the dynamics of an urgent care facility and visualise
    the impact on patient throughput (waiting times), as well as pressures on resource capacity.
    **ðŸ‘ˆ Select *simulation demo* from the sidebar** to dive right in!
